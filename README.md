# A Solution for the M5 Forecasting Competition

The solution can be directly executed from the function, "run" in the script, [final_experiment.R](https://github.com/rakshitha123/M5/blob/master/final_experiment.R). Change the value of **BASE_DIR** variable in line 1 to the checkout location.
The "run" function can be executed with different number of lags. For the competition, 400 lags are used.


To execute with a demo dataset, set "mode" variable in [configs/configs.R](https://github.com/rakshitha123/M5/blob/master/configs/configs.R) to "demo" (this is the default value of the "mode" varibale). To run with the competition dataset, set the "mode" variable to "comp".
